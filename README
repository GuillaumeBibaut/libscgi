Master thoughts : Simple, Delegated

One creating a header and its data is responsible for its life cycle.

This library is an attempt to make it a bit clearer about how a C CGI
should work, and about what should be the minimum assets to make a C
CGI work.


FYI.:
This library is currently under development.
It's usable in its current state, you can check samples and you would
see it's really simple to use.

You can check TODO for upcoming features.

If you need a particular header, feel free to hack one and to do a
pull request with a sample to use it. I'll check if it match the
current code and I'll try to test it.
Be sure to check how a header is developed with scgi-header-cookie.c
as an example.

Keep in mind this library is FreeBSD oriented, I won't accept any
external library use or import.

Documentation ?
The code is. I'll add as much comment as I can inside to describe it.
